                        <p>Trained on billions of text examples (books, articles, websites). AI models learn patterns in grammar, facts, reasoning, and style through extensive processing.</p>
                        
                        <p>Companies gather billions of documents—books, Wikipedia articles, websites, research papers—and feed them through thousands of powerful computers for months. Training just one model like ChatGPT can cost over $100 million. The computer isn't memorizing facts, but learning patterns—understanding how human language works and the patterns of human thought.</p>

                        <p>After initial training, models undergo fine-tuning to teach them how to have helpful conversations. This process involves training on examples of good AI responses to make the model more useful and aligned with human expectations.</p>

                        <p>Once trained and fine-tuned, models are tested and reviewed for quality and safety. This crucial step ensures they don't provide harmful, illegal, or inappropriate information. Alignment makes AI systems beneficial, harmless, and honest in their interactions with users.</p>

                        <p>After extensive testing and refinement, the model is released to the public. When you send a request, it generates responses one word at a time. For each word, it thinks: "Based on all the patterns I've learned and the current conversation, what word comes next?"</p>
                        
                        <p>Think of it like super-powered autocomplete. It's choosing the most likely next word based on the patterns learned during training. And it does that for each subsequent word until it feels the answer is complete.</p>

                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h3>When to Use AI</h3>
                        <p>There are several types of work where AI can be particularly useful, given the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs:</p>
                        
                        <ol class="numbered-list">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Work that requires quantity.</strong> For example, the number of ideas you generate determines the quality of the best idea. You want to generate a lot of ideas in any brainstorming session. Most people stop after generating just a few ideas because they become exhausted but, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4708466" target="_blank">the AI can provide hundreds that do not meaningfully repeat</a>.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                <strong>Work where you are an expert and can assess quickly whether AI is good or bad.</strong> This can involve complicated and exacting work, but it relies on your expertise to determine whether the AI is providing valuable outputs. For example, o1, the new AI model from OpenAI, can solve some PhD-level problems, but it can be hard to know whether its answers are useful without being an expert yourself.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                <strong>Work that involves summarizing large amounts of information</strong>, but where the downside of errors is low, and you are not expected to have detailed knowledge of the underlying information. AI is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01261" target="_blank">good at summarizing novel-length work</a>, but less successful at fact-checking it.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                <strong>Work that is mere translation between frames or perspectives.</strong> For example, you have developed a policy but now have to turn it into a dozen different training documents for different audiences in your organization. AI is very good at this sort of translation, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810364" target="_blank">increasing and decreasing complexity of documents so that people can understand them</a>.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                <strong>Work that will keep you moving forward.</strong> Little things often block our way, and a push might be all we need to accomplish it. When writing prior to AI, I might get stuck on a sentence and walk away from writing for an hour, but now I ask AI <em>give me thirty distinct ways to end this sentence</em>. I would likely not use any of them verbatim, but they may unlock some ways forward I may not have thought of.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                                        <strong>Work that contains some elements that you can understand but need help on the context or details.</strong> <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/12/how-to-read-a-book-using-o1.html" target="_blank">Tyler Cowen suggests using the AI as a companion when reading</a>, because it allows you to ask infinite questions.

                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Work where you need variance</strong>, and where you will select the best answer as an editor or curator. Asking for a variety of solutions - <em>give me 15 ways to rewrite this bullet in radically different styles, be creative</em> - allows you to find ideas that might be interesting.
                                    </li>
                                    
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Work that research shows that AI is almost certainly helpful in</strong> - <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4945566" target="_blank">many kinds of coding</a>, for example.
                                    </li>
                                    
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Work where you need a first pass view</strong> at what a hostile, friendly, or naive recipient might think.
                                    </li>
                                    
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Work that is entrepreneurial</strong>, where you are expected to stretch your expertise widely over many different disciplines, and where the alternative to a good-enough partner is to not be able to act at all. AI can be a surprisingly competent co-founder, helping give mentorship while also acting to build the documents, demos, and approaches that are otherwise likely to be outside your experience.
                                    </li>
                                    
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Work where you need a specific perspective</strong>, and where a simulated first pass from that perspective can be helpful, like reactions from <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/personas" target="_blank">fictional personas</a>.
                                    </li>

                                        <strong>Work that is mere ritual</strong>, long severed from its purpose (like certain standardized reports that no one reads). What, <a href="https://hbr.org/2024/01/rid-your-organization-of-obstacles-that-infuriate-everyone" target="_blank">in the words of Bob Sutton and Huggy Rao</a>, scatters your attention and makes you less valuable? What work serves no useful purpose? In an ideal world, you would remove the work, but you can at least reduce its hold on you by having AI help.
                                    </li>

                                        <strong>Work where you want a second opinion.</strong> Give an AI access to the data and see if it reaches the same conclusion.
                                    </li>

                        <h3>Don't Use AI</h3>
                        <p>We can set aside the obvious scenarios - using AI for illegal purposes, in high-stakes situations where errors could be catastrophic, or for decisions that ethically require human work. Beyond these clear-cut cases here are 5 times not to use AI:</p>
                        
                        <ol class="numbered-list warning-list">
                            <li>
                                <strong>When you need to learn and synthesize new ideas or information.</strong> Asking for a summary is not the same as reading for yourself. Asking AI to solve a problem for you is not an effective way to learn, even if it feels like it should be. To learn something new, you are going to have to do the reading and thinking yourself, though <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/post-apocalyptic-education" target="_blank">you may still find an AI helpful for parts of the learning process</a>.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                <strong>When very high accuracy is required.</strong> The problem with AI errors, the infamous hallucinations, is that, because of how LLMs work, the errors are going to be very plausible. Hallucinations are therefore very hard to spot, and research suggests that people don't even try, <a href="https://www.almendron.com/tribuna/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/falling-asleep-at-the-whee.pdf" target="_blank">"falling asleep at the wheel"</a> and not paying attention. Hallucinations can be reduced, but not eliminated.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                <strong>When you do not understand the failure modes of AI.</strong> AI doesn't fail exactly like a human. You know it can hallucinate, but that is only one form of error: AIs often try to persuade you that they are right, or they might become sycophantic and agree with your incorrect answer. You need to use AI enough to understand these risks.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                <strong>When the effort is the point.</strong> In many areas, people need to struggle with a topic to succeed - writers rewrite the same page, academics revisit a theory many times. By shortcutting that struggle, no matter how frustrating, you may lose the ability to reach the vital "aha" moment. A certain amount of friction seems necessary to make facts stick in the mind, and keep them from slipping down the memory hole.
                            </li>

                                <strong>When AI is bad at the task.</strong> This may seem obvious, but AI is bad at things you wouldn't expect (counting the number of r's in the word "strawberry") and good at things you wouldn't expect (writing a Shakespearean sonnet about how hard it is to count the number of r's in the word strawberry where the first letter of every line spells out two fruits). Unfortunately, there is no general manual to tell you the shape of the <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged" target="_blank">Jagged Frontier of AI abilities</a>, which are constantly evolving. Trial and error, and sharing information with peers, is vital to figuring this out.

                        <p>The observation about people treating AI like Google resonates deeply. The real challenge isn't just teaching prompt engineering but reframing how people think about AI entirely.</p>
                        
                        <p>What if AI education focused less on technical skills and more on developing an experimental mindset—treating AI as a partner to learn from through trial and error? That could bridge the gap between what these models can do and how they're actually used.</p>

**Task:** Review the attached user feedback for our fitness tracking app and identify the top 5 usability issues that should be prioritized for our next update.

**Context:** Our app targets fitness enthusiasts aged 25-45 who work out at least 3 times per week. We recently added new features for workout planning and nutrition tracking, but our app store ratings have dropped from 4.6 to 4.1 stars. We have limited engineering resources, so we need to focus on the most impactful issues first.

**Format:** Present your findings as a prioritized list with:
1. Clear issue title
2. Severity rating (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Brief description of the problem
4. Specific user quotes or evidence from the feedback
5. Potential quick-win solution

                                        <h5>For a 10-year-old:</h5>
                                        <p>Imagine teaching your dog to fetch. At first, your dog doesn't know what to do when you throw a ball. But after practicing many times, your dog learns that when you throw something, it should run after it and bring it back. The dog learned this by practicing over and over. Machine learning is like that, but for computers. Instead of teaching computers exactly what to do with strict rules, we show them lots of examples, and they figure out the patterns themselves - just like your dog learned to fetch!</p>
                                        
                                        <h5>For a high school student:</h5>
                                        <p>Machine learning is a way to make computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every situation. Just as you might recognize patterns in math problems after solving many similar ones, machine learning algorithms find patterns in data. For example, a computer can learn to recognize cats in photos after seeing thousands of cat pictures. Netflix uses machine learning to recommend shows based on what you've watched before, and email services use it to filter spam. It works by adjusting mathematical models based on examples until the computer gets good at making predictions or decisions.</p>
